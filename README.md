# HomeControl
LED and fan control for the house.

## What is it
- Code for an ESP8266 Arduino device that sets up and listens for incoming data from another device, then controls LED arrays.
- Code to stream UDP data to the embedded device (from my Raspberry Pi), and do all kinds of fun animations.
- Code that sets up a stupid simple web interface to control which data is being streamed to the embedded device.

## What devices
- HiLetgo New Version NodeMCU LUA WiFi Internet ESP8266 Development
- Adafruit 2821 Feather HUZZAH with ESP8266 Wi-Fi
- BW5050RGB48T-2811-12V (LED strip)

Started with the Adafruit, switched to the HiLetgo for something cheaper. The only thing I had to change was the pinout I think.
